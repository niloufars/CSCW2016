<h3>Call for Workshop Proposals</h3>
<p>Workshops provide an opportunity to discuss and explore emerging areas of CSCW research with a group of like-minded researchers and practitioners from industry and academia. Workshops may focus on any aspect of CSCW theory or practice, established concerns or new ideas. However, radical new ideas expected to draw a sufficient number of participants are very much encouraged! The goal of a workshop is to share understandings and experiences, to foster research communities, to learn from each other and to envision future directions. For a sample of workshop topics from the last conference, please look at the <a href="http://www.cscw2010.org/program/workshops.php">CSCW 2010</a>, <a href="http://cscw2011.org/program/workshops.html">CSCW 2011</a>, <a href="http://cscw2012.org/program/accepted_workshops.php">CSCW 2012</a>, <a href="http://cscw.acm.org/2013/program_workshop.html">CSCW 2013</a>, and <a href="http://cscw.acm.org/program_workshop.html">CSCW 2014</a> Workshop Programs.</p>

<p>Workshop proposals should consist of an abstract and a detailed proposal. The abstract should be no more than 150 words. The body of the proposal should be no more than 3000 words, and should include a description of the theme(s) of the workshop, the workshop activities and goals, the duration of the workshop (one or two full days), the background of the organizer(s), the maximum number of participants, the means of recruiting and selecting participants, and the equipment and supplies needed to run the workshop.</p>

<p>Please note that workshops receive minimal technology support, which is reflected in the low fee for attending them. This means that organizers should plan to bring their own equipment insofar as it is possible to do so (e.g., projector, laptops, portable supplies) and will be responsible for the security of their own equipment. We encourage workshop organizers to create web-based resources for their workshops so that advertising, submission and organization can be handled online.</p>

<p>Questions concerning workshop proposals should be directed to the CSCW 2015 Workshop Co-Chairs via email: <a href="mailto:workshops2015@cscw.acm.org">workshops2015@cscw.acm.org</a></p>

<p>Workshop proposals should be e-mailed to the Workshop Co-Chairs at workshops2015@cscw.acm.org by 5:00 p.m. PDT on Friday, August 8, 2014. Submissions will be acknowledged via email.</p>

<p>Accepted workshops will need to provide a short description of the workshop for publication on the conference web site containing the workshop title, names and affiliations of organizers, 150-word abstract, workshop web site, and position paper submission or other participation requirements. The due date for the web description is October 15th, 2014.</p>

<p>A final workshop description will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be distributed to all conference attendees in the Conference Extended Abstracts. This description must be submitted by October 18th, 2014 and be formatted in <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform/sigchi-extended-abstracts-word-template/view">Extended Abstract Format</a>.</p>
