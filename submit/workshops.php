				Workshops provide an opportunity to discuss and explore emerging
				areas of CSCW research with a group of like-minded researchers and
				practitioners from industry and academia. Workshops may focus on any
				aspect of CSCW theory or practice, established concerns or new
				ideas. However, radical new ideas expected to draw a sufficient
				number of participants are very much encouraged! The goal of a
				workshop is to share understandings and experiences, to foster
				research communities, to learn from each other and to envision
				future directions. For a sample of workshop topics from the last
				conference, please look at the <a
					href="http://cscw2011.org/program/workshops.html">CSCW 2011</a>, <a
					href="http://cscw2012.org/program/accepted_workshops.php">CSCW 2012</a>,
				<a href="http://cscw.acm.org/2013/program_workshop.html">CSCW 2013</a>,

				and <a

			</p>
			<p>Workshop proposals should consist of an abstract and a detailed
				proposal. The abstract should be no more than 150 words. The body of
				the proposal should be no more than 3000 words, and should include a
				description of the theme(s) of the workshop, the workshop activities
				and goals, the duration of the workshop (one or two full days), the
				background of the organizer(s), the maximum number of participants,
				the means of recruiting and selecting participants, and the
				equipment and supplies needed to run the workshop.</p>
			<p>Please note that workshops receive minimal technology support,
				which is reflected in the low fee for attending them. This means
				that organizers should plan to bring their own equipment insofar as
				it is possible to do so (e.g., projector, laptops, portable
				supplies) and will be responsible for the security of their own
				equipment. We encourage workshop organizers to create web-based
				resources for their workshops so that advertising, submission and
				organization can be handled online.</p>
			<p>Questions concerning workshop proposals should be directed to the
				CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> Workshop Co-Chairs via email: <a
					href="mailto:cscw<?php echo $year; ?>workshops@acm.org">cscw<?php echo $year; ?>workshops@acm.org</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Workshop proposals should be e-mailed to the Workshop Co-Chairs at <a
					href="mailto:cscw<?php echo $year; ?>workshops@acm.org">cscw<?php echo $year; ?>workshops@acm.org</a>
				by 11:59pm&nbsp;PDT on Friday October 16, 2015. Submissions will be
				acknowledged via email.
			</p>
			<p>Accepted workshops will need to provide a short description of the
				workshop for publication on the conference web site containing the
				workshop title, names and affiliations of organizers, 150-word
				abstract, workshop web site, and position paper submission or other
				participation requirements. The due date for the web description and
				workshop link is November 6, 2015.</p>
			<p>
				A final workshop description will be published in the ACM Digital
				Library and will be distributed to all conference attendees in the
				Conference Extended Abstracts. This description must be submitted by
				December 5, 2015 and be formatted in <a
					href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform">Extended
					Abstract Format</a>.
