<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>The ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing is an international and interdisciplinary conference focused on how technology intersects with social practices. In 2016 the CSCW conference will be held in Vancouver, BC, Canada from March 14th-18th, 2016. </p>

<p>We invite papers that detail existing practices, inform the design or deployment of systems, or introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms. The scope of CSCW includes, social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, for socializing, and for entertainment. The technical program seeks novel research results or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities can be in these and related areas:
<ul>
<li><strong>Social and crowd computing.</strong> Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information seeking.</li>
<li><strong>System design.</strong>  Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>Theories and models.</strong>  Critical analysis or organizing theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems.</li>
<li><strong>Empirical investigations.</strong>  Findings, guidelines, and/or studies relating to technologies, practices, or use of communication, collaboration, and social technologies. CSCW welcomes diverse methods and approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Mining and Modeling.</strong>  Studies, analyses and infrastructures for making use of large and small scale data.</li>
<li><strong>Methodologies and tools.</strong>  Novel methods or combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or studying their use.</li>
<li><strong>Domain-specific social and collaborative applications.</strong>  Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies.</strong>  Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch technologies, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSes, or sensing systems.</li>
<li><strong>Crossing boundaries.</strong>  Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.</li>
</ul></p>

<h1>Format and Submission Process Details</h1>

<h3>Submission Process</h3>

<p>Papers must be submitted via the <a href="https://precisionconference.com/~sigchi/" target="_blank">Precision Conference System (PCS)</a> by 5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on June 4th 2014. The site will open for submissions beginning Monday April 21st. Papers in the "Revise & Resubmit" category must be re-submitted via the PCS system by 5:00 p.m. PDT on August 1st 2014.</p>

<p>Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SigCHI regarding specialized conferences: http://www.sigchi.org/conferences organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference</p>

<p>Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<h3>Formatting and Length</h3>

<p>Please use the SIGCHI papers template to format your submission (there is a <a href="CSCWUSpaperformat.doc" target="_blank">Word version</a> and a <a href="cscw2013archivalformatLaTeX.zip" target="_blank">Latex version</a>). Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.</p>

<p>There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length is 10 pages (formerly the maximum length limit), but may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages--shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers longer than 10 pages, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.</p>

<h3>Blind Review Policy</h3>

<p>Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."</p>

<h3>Video Figures</h3>

<p>Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.</p>

<h1>Review process</h1>

<H3>Revision Cycle</H3>

<p>Papers will undergo two review cycles. After the first round of review, a submission will receive either a "Revise & Resubmit" or a "Reject" notification (along with the reviews themselves). Submissions rejected in the first round cannot be revised for CSCW 2016, but authors can begin reworking them for submission to other venues. Authors of papers designated "Revise & Resubmit" will have two weeks to revise their paper in response to the reviewers' comments. Authors will need to allocate time for possible revisions during the period between July 14th and August 1st. Revised papers must be re-submitted via the PCS system by 5:00 p.m. PDT on August 1st. Note that an invitation to "Revise & Resubmit" is not a guarantee of acceptance--the revision will be re-reviewed as the basis for the final decision. This is similar to a journal process, except that it is limited to a single revision with a strict deadline.</p>

<p>The revision cycle enables authors to address issues raised by reviewers that may have been a cause for rejection under prior conference reviewing schemes, such as the need to improve readability/grammar, discuss missing citations, redo some analyses, adopt terminology familiar to the field, and/or reframe ideas more clearly. It also allows authors of papers that may have been accepted under a single-cycle approach to further strengthen their papers, perhaps better positioning themselves for consideration for a "Best of CSCW" recognition. Along with their revised paper, authors submit a letter explaining the key changes they have made, allowing more interaction between authors and reviewers.</p>

<p>This is not an invitation to submit extended abstracts or incomplete papers; please submit only work of publishable quality. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk-rejected without review. Based on prior years experience with this process, we anticipate that roughly half of submissions will be rejected after the first round of this process. Note that the dual-round review process is not inherently tied to any target acceptance rates.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/merrie/temp/change_log_samples.html" target="_blank">examples of "change summary" documents</a> submitted with papers in past CSCWs.</p>

<h3>Review Criteria</h3>

<p>Authors will be able to indicate the primary methodological orientation of their paper--Technical, Empirical (Qualitative), or Empirical (Quantitative)--when they upload the paper to the PCS reviewing system. This information will be used to match the paper with a program committee member who is experienced with work of that character. CSCW values work from a variety of interdisciplinary and methodological perspectives - specific evaluation types are not a prerequisite for acceptance [Greenberg & Buxton, 2008; Olsen, 2007].</p>

<p>The form that reviewers for CSCW will use in the first round will be available for preview in the near future.</p>

<h3>"Best of CSCW" Awards</h3>

<p>CSCW will continue the "Best of CSCW" awards program, in accordance with SIGCHI guidelines. Upon acceptance, papers that have been nominated as noteworthy by reviewers or Program Committee members will receive additional review by the Best Papers Committee, who will identify "Honorable Mention" and "Best" awards. Approximately 5% of submissions may be nominated and 1% of total submissions awarded Best Paper.</p>

<h3><a class='anchortag' name='lastingimpact' style='text-decoration:none;'>"CSCW Lasting Impact" Award</a></h3>

<p>The ACM's Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW 2016) will again bestow the honor of “CSCW Lasting Impact Award”. This award recognizes a paper published at the CSCW conference at least 10 years ago (CSCW 2004 and earlier) that has been extremely influential since its publication. The Lasting Impact Award winner will be determined by a committee consisting of senior members of the CSCW community.
<br /><br />
If you would like to nominate a paper for consideration, please email <a href="mailto:papers2016@cscw.acm.org">papers2016@cscw.acm.org</a> by September 19th 2014 and include: the paper's title, author list, and year of publication, as well as a brief paragraph explaining why the paper deserves recognition for its "lasting impact." Nominations involving personal or institutional conflicts-of-interest will NOT be considered.
</p>

<h3>Accepted Works</h3>

<p>The CSCW Proceedings is a peer-reviewed archival publication. AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference).</p>

<p>Authors seeking information about obtaining a visa for traveling to the conference can find such details <a href="<?php echo $basePath; ?>/attend/visas.php">here</a>.</p>
