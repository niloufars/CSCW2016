			<p>CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> will include an interactive poster category for late-breaking and preliminary results, smaller results not suitable for a full or short paper, innovative ideas not yet validated through user studies, early student research, and other research best presented in an interactive forum.
			</p>
			<p>Posters will be presented in a special Poster Session where researchers will interact directly with conference attendees. The posters will then remain up throughout the remainder of the conference.
			</p>
			<p>Accepted Interactive Poster abstracts will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to conference attendees as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts.
			</p>			
			
		  	<h3>Interactive Poster Submission Requirements</h3>
		  	<p>Interactive Poster submissions should include an extended abstract no longer than 4 pages, including all figures and references, in <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/publications/chipubform" target="_blank">Extended Abstract Format</a>. This extended abstract will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts. In addition, submissions should also include a separate Tabloid sized (11 Ã— 17 inches) draft of the poster for review purposes. Please submit the 4-page paper in PDF format and name this file ContactAuthorLastName_paper.pdf. Please submit the poster draft in PDF format and name this file ContactAuthorLastName_poster.pdf. Both the extended abstract and the poster drafts should include author names and affiliations (Interactive Posters are not anonymous submissions).
		  	</p>
		  	<p>Interactive poster abstract submissions (extended abstract and poster draft) must be uploaded online via the <a href="https://precisionconference.com/~sigchi/" target="_blank"> Precision Conference System (PCS) </a>  by 5:00pm (17:00) Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on November 10, 2014 to be considered. All attachments must be less than 5MB.

		  	<h3>Interactive Poster Abstract Authoring Tips</h3>
		  	<p>The following tips may help you prepare a successful Poster abstract:</p>
		  	<ul>
		  		<li>State the contribution and originality of your work clearly and explicitly: What is the problem? How are you solving this problem? How does your approach help? Why is it better than other available approaches?
		  		</li>	
		  		<li>Interactive posters abstracts may be chosen based on either the significance of the problem or the originality of your approach.
		  		</li>
		  		<li>Focus on the contribution of your work rather than the background, including just enough background information to make clear how your work differs from significant prior research.
		  		</li>
		  		<li>Include the major graphical elements that will likely be used in the poster itself.
		  		</li>
		  	</ul>
		  	
		  	<h3>Printing, Displaying and Presenting Your Poster</h3>
            <p>The space allocated for each poster is 48 inches by 48 inches. Posters are recommended to be no longer or wider than 45 inches in either dimension; however, up to 47 inches is allowable. Smaller posters are acceptable. For example, either A0 or A1 is an acceptable size for the poster.
            </p>
            <p>Posters should be affixed to the poster boards with push pins, not tape. The conference will provide push pins. Each board will have a label indicating where your poster should be placed; please allow time to find your board and set up your poster.
            </p>
            <p>The Interactive Posters venue is a unique opportunity to get feedback on your research by directly engaging with other conference attendees in an informal setting. As started in 2014, we will kick off the poster session with brief 2-4 minute presentations, followed by an interactive session during which presenters will further discuss their work with attendees.
            </p>
