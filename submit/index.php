			<p>We invite submission to a wide range of venues including papers,
				posters, demos, panels, workshops, and a doctoral consortium. The
				scope of CSCW spans socio-technical domains including work, home,
				education, healthcare, the arts, leisure, and entertainment. The
				conference seeks novel research results or new ways of thinking
				about, studying, or supporting shared activities in these and
				related areas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Social and crowd computing.</strong> Studies, theories,
					designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing
					social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming,
					crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or
					collaborative information behaviors.</li>
				<li><strong>System Design.</strong> Hardware, architectures,
					infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations,
					algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social
					and collaborative systems and experiences.</li>
				<li><strong>Theories.</strong> Critical analysis or theory with
					clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative
					systems.</li>
				<li><strong>Empirical investigations.</strong> Findings, guidelines,
					and/or studies related to communication, collaboration, and social
					technologies, practices, or use. CSCW welcomes diverse methods and
					approaches.</li>
				<li><strong>Mining and Modeling.</strong> Studies, analyses and
					infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data.</li>
				<li><strong>Methodologies and tools.</strong> Novel methods or
					combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or
					studying their use.</li>
				<li><strong>Domain-specific social and collaborative applications.</strong>
					Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming,
					ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global
					collaboration, or other domains.</li>
				<li><strong>Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies.</strong>
					Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds,
					multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture
					recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSes, or
					sensing systems.</li>
				<li><strong>Crossing boundaries.</strong> Studies, prototypes, or
					other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines,
					distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better
					understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial
					boundaries.</li>
