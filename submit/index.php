        <p>We invite submission to a wide range of venues including papers, posters, demos, panels, workshops, and a doctoral consortium. The scope of CSCW spans socio-technical domains including work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, leisure, and entertainment. The conference seeks novel research results or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities in these and related areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Social and crowd computing.</strong> Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.
          </li>
          <li><strong>System Design.</strong> Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Theories.</strong> Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Empirical investigations.</strong> Findings, guidelines, and/or studies related to communication, collaboration, and social technologies, practices, or use. CSCW welcomes diverse methods and approaches.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Mining and Modeling.</strong> Studies, analyses and infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Methodologies and tools.</strong> Novel methods or combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or studying their use.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Domain-specific social and collaborative applications.</strong> Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies.</strong> Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSes, or sensing systems.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Crossing boundaries.</strong> Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.
