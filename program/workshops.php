			<strong>Abstract:</strong>
			The workshop focuses on the new work ecologies emerging from implementation and use of information infrastructures in healthcare (IIH).  As IIH “grows” through organizational and regulatory mechanisms, CSCW researchers grapple with the shifting nature of healthcare data. CSCW has long been concerned with coordination, cooperation, and communication among interdisciplinary occupations in healthcare. Yet, while medical record keeping is still a primary function of IIH, second order data usages are increasingly large foci of IIH design and use. Facilitating development of health data practice and infrastructure is an area ripe for CSCW research. Critical topics include but are not limited to: re-use of clinical data for second order usages; design of artifacts and infrastructures; politics of creating and using data; algorithmic authority of IIH and effects on the exercise of expertise and discretion of healthcare professions; new forms of healthcare data work, including new occupations; data-driven accountability and management in healthcare”<br><br>

			<strong>Saturday February 27</strong><br>
			<strong>Organizers:</strong><br>
			<strong>Contact:</strong> Charlie Gullström, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweeden <br>
			Joke Kort, TNO, Human Behavior and Organizational Innovation, Groningen, The Netherlands<br><br>

			<strong>Abstract:</strong>
			The physical workplace – a hub for communication, collaboration and co-located interaction – can no longer be taken for granted. Today, the design of intelligent interactive media, physical products and ubiquitous environments has passed the phase of being technology-driven. Meaning, insight and experience are now the key design drivers for the bridging of digital and physical design. We foresee how new interconnected knowledge systems – objects/devices, buildings and even cities created from web-based services and IoT – thoroughly transform CSCW. A wide spectrum of services already invites users to seamlessly move between real and virtual workspaces, using a range of previously separated media channels. This interdisciplinary workshop welcomes researchers and practitioners to a day-long exchange targeting User eXperience (UX) and, specifically, the relationship between social and spatial connectedness in mediated and virtual work environments. Examples from ongoing research and developments informs a discussion on how the borders between the virtual and real become increasingly obsolete.<br><br>

			<strong>Abstract:</strong>
			In the 25 years since Ellis, Gibbs, and Rein proposed the time-space taxonomy, research in the ‘same time, same place’ quadrant has diversified, perhaps even fragmented. The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together researchers with diverse, yet convergent interests in tabletop, surface, mobile and wearable technologies, and those interested in the social aspects of interaction, such as conversation analysis and ethnomethodology. These communities have matured considerably, and produced significant exemplars of systems, methods, and studies concerned with collocated interactions. Yet, new challenges abound as people wear and carry more devices than ever, creating fragmented device ecologies at work, and changing the ways we socialise with each other. In this workshop we seek to start a dialogue to look back as well as forward, review best practices, discuss and design paper-prototypes using the collocated design framework, to consider how we might address new and future challenges through collocated design practice.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong>
			Previous workshops examined how individual users adopt and adapt technologies to meet local needs, “completing design through use.” However, there has been little systematic study of how groups engage collaboratively in these activities. This workshop opens a discussion for these forms of collaborative appropriation, including field studies, design explorations, theoretical accounts, and critical reflections. <br>
			We invite submissions addressing the following and other topics in collaborative appropriation:<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Practical experiences in design for collaborative appropriation</li>
			<li>Flexible, open design and tailorability as support for collaborative appropriation</li>
			<li>Design goals, guidelines, and principles  for collaborative appropriation</li>
			<li>Major drivers to design for collaborative appropriation</li>
			<li>Emergent roles (actors) in collaborative appropriation practices</li>
			<li>Characterization and differentiation of collaborative appropriation between couples, teams, groups, and communities</li>
			<li>Lessons learned  from other design movements and research domains to inform the design for collaborative appropriation</li>
			</ul>

			<strong>Abstract:</strong>Social signaling theory (SST) is an analytical approach for interpreting interactions in social settings that are not ostensibly explicit. Social computing researchers are beginning to apply SST to study questions of identity, trust, reliability, and multi-cultural communication. Example framing questions include:
			<ul>
			<li><em>Relationships</em>: How does social signaling theory complement existing theories used for studying social computing systems?
			</li>
			<li><em>Applications</em>: What types of questions about social computing systems cannot currently be answered from an SST stance?
			</li>
			<li><em>Interventions</em>: How can Social Signaling Theory be leveraged to facilitate the design of next generation social computing systems?
			</li>
			</ul>
			
			During this workshop, through a variety of creative activities and lively discussions, we will begin to unpack SST, map how it is currently being used in research, and investigate the potential for future exploration.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> There are new potentials for transformative developments in government, work life, science, and emergency response as the use of participatory and social media has become widespread in society and enabled a more collaborative information production. However, these new platforms for participation have not solved many of the pre-crowd problems regarding participation, such as lack of representativeness and flawed deliberative processes. Therefore it is important and relevant to look at the power relations within crowd production and to examine how different tools handle participatory processes in the crowd.<br><br>

			This workshop examines different types of participation in crowd work such as crowdsourced policymaking, crisis management, citizen science and paid crowd work, among others, focusing on relations and power dynamics within and beyond the crowds. We welcome researchers from a diversity of disciplines and perspectives to formulate a typology of participation in crowd work.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> This one-day workshop aims to stimulate discussion in Cyberinfrastructure (CI) Studies on closing the feedback loop between research, practice and policy. As scientific work becomes increasingly collaborative, interdisciplinary and distributed, practitioners of science are seeking ways to make working across boundaries less burdensome. CI studies, with their focus on topics such as data sharing and reuse, collaboration and coordination, management of virtual organizations, citizen science, and development of scientific software, have the potential to provide evidence to support practitioners. Yet little research has focused on how to do so. Here, we will explore the public health concept of dissemination and implementation (D&I) and how to apply its core tenets to implementing evidence-based interventions for the practice of science. We will take a “hackathon” approach, involving CI researchers and practitioners in developing a rapid prototype of an evidence-based intervention such as a practice guideline, policy proposal, or app design.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite being freely accessible, open online community data can be difficult to use effectively. To access and analyze large amounts of data, researchers must become familiar with the meaning of data values. Then they must also find a way to obtain and process the datasets to extract their desired vectors of behavior and content. This process is fraught with problems that are solved over and over again by each research team/lab that breaks into a new dataset.  Those who lack the necessary technical skills may never be able to start.<br><br>

			In this workshop, we will experiment with technologies and documentation protocols designed to make the process of “breaking into” a new dataset easier. Participants will get to use these technologies to explore new datasets and we'll use their feedback to improve our systems and make recommendations to the field.

			<br><br>

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> Networked platforms for peer-to-peer exchange and on-demand labor, along with the practices that they foster, are attracting increasing attention from CSCW scholars. This workshop seeks to bring the emerging community together to explore how the new domain of “sharing economy” research could help shift forward broader conceptual and theoretical efforts within CSCW, and how, on the other hand, we might utilize prior work more effectively to inform our research agenda and efforts in this emerging sub-area of the field. In particular, the workshop focuses on the future of platforms as sites of work, collaboration and trust. The workshop approaches sharing and the “sharing economy” phenomenon inclusively, adopting a “big tent” approach to invite broad participation. The one-day event will consist of diverse activities, with an emphasis on in-depth conversations, community building, and support for establishing new collaborations.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> In this workshop we will host presentations from researchers performing online experiments and spend a half day helping attendees create experiments using the Volunteer Science platform.  Current approaches to online science use new information technologies to collect and processes data and engage citizen scientists across the globe. Programs like Zooniverse, Fold.It, and SciStarter demonstrate the power of recruiting online volunteers as participants and contributors to research. Platforms like Project Implicit and Volunteer Science confirm that a wide range of social scientific research can be conducted with volunteers in online laboratories. <br><br>
			In this workshop, a group of scholars with wide-ranging experience in this area will discuss existing and emerging approaches to online experimentation. Participants will learn about designing and running online studies and will be given access to the Volunteer Science research platform (volunteerscience.com) where they will work with researchers to develop, test, and deploy their own online studies.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> While there is a reasonable body of knowledge on how to support collaboration among members of virtual teams, those in which team members are separated by distance and have to rely on technology to communicate and to coordinate work, how to motivate such collaboration remains an open question. Gamification, the act of applying game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts, has being pointed out as a means to engage and motivate people to achieve their goals. However, we lack evidence on the topic. Therefore, we invite researchers, students, and practitioners to discuss in this one-day workshop gamification as a motivator to foster collaboration in virtual teams. We would like to explore three key issues within this general theme: 1) the activities that can be gamified aiming to motivate collaboration in virtual settings, 2) the development of a gamification framework to support gamification of such activities, and 3) the requirements for software tools that support gamification processes.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> The study and analysis of large and complex data sets offer a wealth of insights in a variety of applications. Computational approaches provide researchers access to broad assemblages of data, but the insights extracted may lack the rich detail that qualitative approaches have brought to the understanding of sociotechnical phenomena. How do we preserve the richness associated with traditional qualitative methods while utilizing the power of large data sets? How do we uncover social nuances or consider ethics and values in data use?<br><br>

			These and other questions are explored by human-centered data science, an emerging field at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW), human computation, and the statistical and computational techniques of data science. This workshop, the first of its kind at CSCW, seeks to bring together researchers interested in human-centered approaches to data science to collaborate, define a research agenda, and form a community.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong>Computational algorithms have recently emerged as the subject of fervent public and academic debates. What animates many of these debates is a perceived lack of clarity as to what algorithms actually are, what precisely they do, and which human-technology-relations their application may bring about. Therefore, this CSCW workshop critically discusses computational algorithms and the diverse ways in which humans relate to them—focusing particularly upon work practices and investigating how algorithms facilitate, regulate, and require human labor, as well as how humans make sense of and react to them. The purpose of this workshop is threefold: first, to chart the diversity of algorithmic technologies as well as their application, appropriation, use and presence in work practices; second, to probe analytic vocabularies that account for empirical diversity; third, to discuss implications for design that come out of our understandings of algorithms and the technologies through which they are enacted.

			<strong>Abstract:</strong> Emergencies are critical situations that demand immediate action to avoid adverse consequences to life and property. A key challenge in Emergency Management is decision-making under time pressure, with an overload of unconfirmed, uncertain and conflicting information, including the management of many people, with distinct and possibly fluid roles, in different places. Collaboration in these settings is an interesting element, since emergency response generally involves multiple agencies and the public, which have different views, protocols and priorities, but must act in concert to handle the situation. In addition, an increasing amount of virtual information is necessary to inform and manage volunteers. The goal of this workshop is to identify and map the main challenges of collaboration in crisis situations, review current research methods and approaches to address them and from there to address the lack of formal processes, structures, methodologies and tools, following a multidisciplinary approach.
