				<strong>Title:</strong> Beyond the Social Media Echo Chamber: Data Journalism with Search Data
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> How do you tell stories
				with one of the world's biggest publicly available datasets? Where
				are the insights in such a nuanced set of information, and how can
				they be relayed in ways that are visually interesting and tell us
				real lessons about the way we live today? Can that data be used to
				predict elections, reveal what we really think about the world's big
				issues, or even how to analyze roadkill figures?
			</p>
			<p>

				<strong>Title:</strong> How design decisions have shaped Instagram's
				community, and vice-versa
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Abstract:</strong> CSCW research is rich with examples of
				how the design, defaults, and social norms of digital systems affect
				behavior, be it in shared calendars or on social sites. How does
				this play out at a scale of 400 million users? In this talk,
				Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger will walk through how design
				decisions at Instagram -- large and small -- have influenced user
				behavior in the first five years of the product. For example, how
				has Instagram's asymmetric “follow” model shaped the connections its
				users have formed? Mike will also discuss examples of emergent norms
				that have arisen unexpectedly on Instagram, but can be traced to
				specific design decisions in the product.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Bio:</strong> Mike Krieger is a software engineer and
				entrepreneur who co-founded the social media service Instagram, and
				still serves as the product's CTO. Instagram is an online mobile
				photo- and video-sharing social network, with over 400 million
				active users.
