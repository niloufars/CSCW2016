                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Building on recent research in privacy management and disclosure in networked spaces, this two-day workshop examines networked privacy challenges from a broader perspective by (1) identifying the most important issues researchers will need to address in the next decade and (2) working to create actionable solutions for these privacy issues. This workshop comes at a critical time for organizations, researchers, and consumers, as content-sharing applications soar in popularity and more privacy and security vulnerabilities emerge. Workshop participants and organizers will work together to develop a guiding framework for the community that highlights the future challenges and opportunities of networked privacy.
                </p>

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>In this workshop, we propose to situate health, first as a proactive (de-medicalised) experience that facilitates innovation, creativity and improved quality of life; second, we seek specifically to use this workshop to explore how CSCW methods and design experience may inform such an exploration to support interactive technology from social/industrial collaborative infrastructure to individual/social interactive systems for what we call Wellth Creation, that is sustainable health and wellbeing IT that is Proactive and Aspirtational.
                </p>
                <p>We ask, what is the role of CSCW as methodology and epistemology in the development of interactive technology for Proactive Health & Wellbing? What contributions are CSCW researchers best prepared make to the critical and timely development of re-designing our cultures to support health as a social good? This workshop proposes to dedicate its two days to exploring these questions and to produce a research agenda for CSCW for Proactive Health. These questions are both critical and timely.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Challenges of local communities such as encouraging civic engagement and facilitating collaboration to address local issues have motivated researchers and practitioners to explore the role of technologies in the city life. The goal of this workshop is to open a discussion on how to design, build and study technology infrastructure to support cities, neighborhoods and local communities. We aim to create a publicly accessible repository of infrastructure tools and to facilitate the cross-pollination of ideas about technology in local contexts among the researchers, practitioners and residents interested in this area. At the workshop, participants will collaborate with Vancouver’s residents and technology practitioners in order to explore the past, present and future of research in this space, co-construct the infrastructuring tools repository, discuss key information challenges of local communities and brainstorm solutions and opportunities to address them. Discussion and ideas generated will be archived online to be available to the larger research community.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Location-based social network apps for dating have had explosive growth over the past few years. Although they have many possible uses, casual and sexual encounters remain an important part of their draw. For CSCW, these apps are interesting to study: they offer a context to explore issues of identity and self-presentation, geography and locality, privacy and security, as well as motivation and usage habits.
                </p>
                <p>In this one-day workshop, we invite researchers, students, and practitioners from a diverse range of backgrounds, including CSCW, computer science, sociology, and public health, to discuss these issues and more, as well as exploring the difficulties and challenges inherent in this research. In addition to exploring the issues around apps for sex and dating, participants will also help to bring some of these sensitive, yet important topics into the mainstream of CSCW research.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>The evolution of social technology and research methods present ongoing challenges to studying people online. Recent high-profile cases have prompted discussion among both the research community and the general public about the ethical implications of researching humans, their information, and their activities in large-scale digital contexts. Examples of scientific and market research involving Facebook users and OKCupid clients exemplify the ethical complexities of both studying and manipulating online user behavior. When does data science become human subjects research, and what are our obligations to these subjects as researchers? Drawing from previous work around the ethics of digital research, one goal of this workshop is to work towards a set of guiding principles for CSCW scholars doing research online.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Open collaboration systems like Wikipedia, Imgur, Zooniverse, StackExchange, and Reddit have shown that networked communities of volunteer contributors can produce and maintain immense, valuable public resources. A growing body of work within the CSCW research community has come to recognize novel opportunities and challenges that openness brings with it. For example: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distributed production and the need for quality control</li>
                    <li>Maintaining volunteer motivation to participate</li>
                    <li>Distributing the processes for articulation and governance</li>
                    <li>Community maintenance via socializing newcomers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, findings from these academic studies do not always permeate the boundaries between scholarship and practice. Furthermore, many important phenomena related to peer production are not yet fully understood. This workshop will focus on characterizing areas of research within the domain of Open Collaboration Systems (OCS’s) where partnerships between academic and industry researchers can both increase our scientific understanding of OCS’s and also support those systems through research. This workshop's purpose is to bring together researchers on both sides of the "data divide" to identify current challenges and opportunities for future research within these research areas, and to develop a preliminary set of requirements for improved resource sharing and collaboration between OC enterprises and academic research institutions.</p>

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>The workshop organizers are members of an informal committee currently planning CSCW 2017 in Brazil. As we get set for this event, it is paramount to enroll a broader number of CSCW researchers in Latin America (LA) in the broader CSCW community. CSCW research in LA has been active since the mid 1990’s although largely disconnected from the broader international CSCW. It is critical to acknowledge this history and collectively understand how the CSCW community can learn from CSCW in LA and how LA researchers can be better represented in and integrated into international CSCW. The goal of this workshop is twofold. First, to provide a forum for researchers working in LA to present their work for the international CSCW community, and second, to allow the international CSCW community to understand the issues around doing CSCW research in LA. Senior discussants will be invited to discuss the work of LA researchers and introduce key issues from their regions, therefore facilitating the cross-region conversations among participants.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Building on last year’s successful CSCW 2014 workshop on Feminism and Social Media, we propose a follow-on workshop to bring together a set of CSCW scholars around the theme of feminist perspectives in social computing and technology. We will explore theoretical and methodological approaches to the topic and, draw on literature and empirical studies to build a set of generative and creative dialogues around the topics of diversity, sexual orientation, cultural attitudes, sociopolitical affiliations, and other emergent themes. Conversations will be particularly directed toward the challenges of using a feminist approach in CSCW scholarship, identifying both productive and problematic research practices. We expect this session to open new feminist dialogues about current issues in CSCW from sexuality and identity on social media, labor and technology development, and gender inequality within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math + Arts and Design (STEAM) collaborative efforts, and other emergent areas of interest.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>In this workshop we consider new financial services from a CSCW and Social Computing perspective.  In particular, we will bring together researchers, policy-makers and practitioners who are interested in new financial services such as mobile payments, digital money, microfinance, mobile commerce, and are interested in the adoption and use of these new services by special sub-populations. Also of interest in this workshop will be the use of social analytics to understand financial markets and create new services.  We also hope to explore the underlying group and network mechanisms that promote trust and enable commerce (e.g., solidarity lending groups).

                <p>Human behavior increasingly involves digital online software, where the activities and resources that support (1) learning, (2) work, and (3) collaboration overlap and are placed in far greater proximity than the physical world – often just a tab or window away. What scientific and practical gains in 21st century learning, work, and collaboration can be achieved by integrating and contrasting these three areas’ relevant technologies, scientific communities, and industry practitioners?
                </p>
                <p>For example: How can software for collaborative work incorporate learning? Which methods are effective for coordinating diverse experts to iteratively improve online educational resources? How can online learning improve the skill set and labor force for crowd work? The workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e.g., platforms similar to Odesk, MechanicalTurk); education, psychology, & MOOCs (e.g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e.g. attendees of CHI, CSCW, AAAI’s HCOMP).

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                <p>Co-located environments are often seen as ideal group work settings since they provide a rich communication environment (e.g. delay-free voice communication, face-to-face interaction, eye gaze, and non-verbal communication) that promotes awareness and coordination. However, multi-device ecologies, in which co-located collaborators utilize multiple personal devices (e.g., laptops, tablets) or personal devices in conjunction with large shared displays, such as digital walls or tabletops, can interfere with common face-to-face communication and collaboration strategies. These contexts shift group members’ focus, at least some of the time, toward their personal devices and away from their collaborators or any shared artifacts. Group communication and coordination can easily breakdown in these scenarios due to the lack of shared group focus. This workshop will explore design techniques to address this issue, and improve group awareness in these co-located multi-device ecologies. This will be accomplished through group presentations, brainstorming sessions, and small-group breakout sessions.
