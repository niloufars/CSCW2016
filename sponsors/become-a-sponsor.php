			<h1>Become a Sponsor</h1>
			<p>The expense of holding the CSCW conference is paid from two
				sources of income: registration fees paid by the attendees and
				sponsorships from corporations, universities, and other
				institutions. Sponsorships are very important to the financial
				health of CSCW conferences, and the assistance provided by our
				sponsors is greatly appreciated. Sponsorsâ€™ funds allow CSCW
				conferences to hold down the cost of registration, especially for
				students.</p>
			<p>CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> will provide benefits to sponsors in 
				exchange for their financial support. The principal benefit is 
				public acknowledgment of sponsors in the opening and closing 
				plenary sessions, on the conference website, in the proceedings 
				and final program, and on tote bags. The conference will also 
				acknowledge our more generous sponsors for their contribution to 
				well attended social events including receptions, the conference 
				banquet/party, coffee breaks, and student lunches. Their 
				contribution to these events is noted in the conference program 
				and on signs at the events.</p>
			<p>Sponsors are given the opportunity to provide information (e.g., 
				brochures) directly to CSCW attendees. Higher level sponsors are 
				invited to present demonstrations of their relevant technology. 
				CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> will also accommodate sponsors 
				interested in recruiting conference attendees. Sponsors may also 
				receive complimentary CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> registrations.</p>
			<p>Sponsors contribute to the CSCW conference community in myriad
				ways, including funding. We recognize the valuable contributions of
				our sponsors, and some CSCW participants in one year become
				sponsoring firm researchers the next. We are ready to discuss how
				you would like to contribute or benefit from the conference.</p>
			<p>CSCW <?php echo $year; ?> offers four levels of sponsorship: 
				Champion, Benefactor, Contributor, and Friend. All champion-level 
				sponsors will be recognized with signs at the conference banquet.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Champions ($15,000 or greater contribution)</li>
				<li>Benefactors ($10,000 or greater contribution)</li>
				<li>Contributors ($5,000 or greater contribution)</li>
				<li>Friends (contribution of less than $5,000)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Benefits of sponsorship levels can be tailored to meet the needs of
				sponsors. Please contact the Sponsorship co-chairs at <a
					href="mailto:cscw<?php echo $year; ?>sponsorship@acm.org">cscw<?php echo $year; ?>sponsorship@acm.org</a>
				about becoming a sponsor for CSCW <?php echo $year; ?>.</p>
