				</p>
				
				<h3>You commit to:</h3>
				<p>Complete 20 hours of volunteer work at the conference during
					March 14-18, 2016. In return, you get: (please note: SV benefits
					are still being discussed)</p>

					<li>A fabulous t-shirt sure to be the envy of all conference goers</li>
					<li>Daily lunches with faculty mentors</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>While the volunteer duties are not always glamorous, they do provide a unique opportunity to interact closely with CSCW contributors, attendees, and other student volunteers. Volunteering provides a structured, cordial environment for students in various stages of their research career to become part of the CSCW community. Students often report that the 'social networks' they build from these meetings are the greatest benefit of being a volunteer. Indeed, it is not uncommon for future collaborations, internships/jobs, and friendships to be made through the SV experience.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Qualifications</h3>
			<p>Volunteers must be undergraduate, Master's, or Ph.D. students during the Fall semester of the 2014 academic year. All students, regardless of discipline, are encouraged to apply. No experience is required, but we are looking for enthusiastic, reliable people.</p>
			
			<h3>Selection Process</h3>
			<p>6 student volunteer spots have been assigned to experienced student volunteers to serve as day captains, and the other spots (about 30) will be randomly assigned by the lottery system to applicants who apply by Oct. 24. Finally, there will be a contest for designing the wonderful t-shirt that our SVs wear. The waitlisted applicant who submits the best t-shirt design will be assigned a SV spot.  Further information about the t-shirt design contest will be emailed to waitlisted applicants after the initial notification deadline.
			</p>
			<p>Those volunteers initially selected will be notified on October 27, 2014 so that they can begin making any necessary arrangements and get involved in the online student volunteer community. The waiting list will consist of applications received by the deadline but not initially selected. Applications received after the deadline will be placed at the end of the waiting list in the order in which they are received.
			</p>
			<p>Historically, more students apply than can be accepted, so early application is encouraged. However, applicants on the waiting list are often accepted, so do not be discouraged if you are applying close to or after the preliminary deadline. Some volunteers always drop out, so we highly encourage students to continue checking the waitlist.</p>
