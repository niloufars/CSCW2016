			<h1>Local Attractions</h1>

			<h2>Tourist Attractions</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Ferry Building - Right across the street from the conference
					hotel, San Francisco&rsquo;s ferry building is a ferry terminal, a
					shopping/food destination, and on the weekend an epic outdoor
					farmers and crafts market. A great place to grab lunch between
					sessions! (<a href="http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/">http://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf - A classic San Francisco attraction, go
					for the fun seaside attractions, stay for the sea lions. (<a
					href="http://visitfishermanswharf.com/">http://visitfishermanswharf.com/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Golden Gate Bridge - Iconic Golden Gate Bridge connects San
					Francisco to Marin County. It&rsquo;s scenic to visit from the SF
					side, and you can walk or bike onto or across it, even going so far
					as Sausalito for lunch. Bikes are available for rent all over San
					Francisco. (<a href="http://goldengatebridge.org/visitors/">http://goldengatebridge.org/visitors/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Coit Tower - Located in Telegraph Hill, walking distance from
					the conference hotel, the 1922 Art Deco tower and its art make an
					easy and beautiful outing from the conference. (<a
					href="http://sfrecpark.org/destination/telegraph-hill-pioneer-park/coit-tower/">http://sfrecpark.org/destination/telegraph-hill-pioneer-park/coit-tower/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Alcatraz - You need to take a ferry to Alcatraz, which is a bit
					pricy, but in our opinion quite worthwhile if you have the time and
					interest; it is a visually and emotionally captivating excursion.
					Ferries are available at Pier 33. (<a
					href="http://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm">http://www.nps.gov/alca/index.htm</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Cable cars - Hang off the side of one of San Francisco&rsquo;s
					iconic cable cars. You can catch them from a variety of stations
					along Market Street in downtown San Francisco, or ride along the
					Embarcadero (where the hotel is located) in a vintage car. (<a
					href="http://www.sfcablecar.com/">http://www.sfcablecar.com/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Chinatown - The largest Chinatown outside of Asia and the oldest
					in North America is best explored on foot. Eat some delicious
					Chinese food and explore the many stores (<a
					href="http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com">http://www.sanfranciscochinatown.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Ghirardelli Square - Originally a chocolate factory, this square
					now hosts a variety of waterfront stores and restaurants and, of
					course, some delicious chocolate and ice cream! (<a
					href="http://www.ghirardellisq.com">http://www.ghirardellisq.com</a>).
				</li>
				<li>Japanese Tea Garden - Don&rsquo;t miss the oldest public
					Japanese Garden in the U.S., which is also where the fortune cookie
					was introduced to Americans. Enjoy the serene atmosphere while you
					sip some tea in their tea house (<a
					href="http://japaneseteagardensf.com">http://japaneseteagardensf.com</a>)
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Restaurants</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Aziza/Mourad - Chef Mourad Lahlou&rsquo;s restaurants serve
					creative Moroccan food in traditional ambience. Mourad is
					newly-opened and more pricey but with beautiful surroundings (<a
					href="http://mouradsf.com">http://mouradsf.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Burma Superstar - Never had Burmese food? You need to try this.
					Locations in San Francisco and Oakland. (<a
					href="http://www.burmasuperstar.com/">http://www.burmasuperstar.com/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Chez Panisse - Alice Waters&rsquo; famed Berkeley eatery is
					worth a trek (the BART train is a good way to get there).
					Reservations are hard to come by, but plan in advance either for
					the upstairs casual bistro, or the much fancier (and pricier) pre
					fixe downstairs dining room. (<a href="http://www.chezpanisse.com/">http://www.chezpanisse.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Dosa on Valencia - South Indian fare with a California take. Get
					reservations in advance. Locations on Valencia St and Fillmore St.
					(<a href="http://dosasf.com">http://dosasf.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Flour + Water - SFs top pizza and fancy Italian. Tough to get
					into. Go early and be prepared to wait, but it&rsquo;s worth it. (<a
					href="http://www.flourandwater.com/">http://www.flourandwater.com/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Nopalito - Traditional Mexican food with local and organic
					ingredients. (<a href="http://www.nopalitosf.com">http://www.nopalitosf.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Slanted Door - Chef Charles Phan&rsquo;s nationally-acclaimed
					Vietnamese restaurant in the Ferry building has great views of the
					Bay and delicious food. (<a href="http://www.slanteddoor.com">http://www.slanteddoor.com</a>)
				</li>
				<li>Yank Sing - Amazing and authentic dim sum in the Rincon Center,
					close to the conference hotel. Crowded. Worth it. (<a
					href="http://www.yanksing.com/">http://www.yanksing.com/</a>)
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Nature &amp; Exercise</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Golden Gate Park - Golden Gate Park has tons to do whether
					you&rsquo;re up for a quick visit or a longer stay. Lots of trails
					for hiking and biking, botanical gardens, the California Academy of
					Sciences, and the De Young museum, just to name a few (there is
					even a herd of bison that live in the park!). To get there grab the
					N-Judah Muni train from Embarcadero, right across from the
					conference hotel. (<a
					href="http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/golden-gate-park-guide/">http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/golden-gate-park-guide/</a>)
				</li>
				<li>East Bay Parks - The hills above Berkeley and Oakland are a
					continuous string of parks. Hike for miles and witness stunning
					views of the bay starting in Tilden park which is accessible and
					wonderful above Berkeley. (<a
					href="http://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden.htm">http://www.ebparks.org/parks/tilden.htm</a>)

				</li>
			</ul>

					in the world (<a href="http://www.asianart.org">http://www.asianart.org</a>)

					href="http://www.computerhistory.org">http://www.computerhistory.org</a>)
				</li>
				<li>And, of course, just down the street from the hotel is the

			</ul>
			
			<h2>Kids &amp; Family</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>San Francisco Zoo</li>
				<li>Oakland Zoo</li>
				<li>Exploratorium</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Bigger Adventures</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Wine Country - Visit Napa, Sonoma, or Russian River for some
					scenic country and amazing wine. You&rsquo;ll need to rent a car or
					catch a tour bus from San Francisco</li>
				<li>Half Moon Bay - Head South along the peninsula to the quaint
					beach town where, among other things, you can get great fish tacos.</li>
				<li>Santa Cruz - Further south (1.5-2 hours from SF) there&rsquo;s
					tons to do in Santa Cruz, including the iconic beach boardwalk.</li>
				<li>Muir Wood and Mt. Tam - Muir Woods is perhaps the most famous of
					the Redwood forests. Think awe inspiring trees and ferny
					undergrowth. Again you&rsquo;ll need to either catch a tour or have
					access to a car to get there, but it&rsquo;s typically an hour or
					less to get there. Bring a good jacket.</li>
				<li>Sausalito - Just over the Golden Gate Bridge, Sausalito is
					lovely on a sunny day, and a great place for window shopping and a
					bite in a lovely Bay setting.</li>
				<li>Monterey and Carmel-by-the-Sea - Even further south than Santa
					Cruz are Monterey and Carmel. Perhaps the most accessible
					attraction is Monterey Bay Aquarium, which is 100% worth a visit if
					you make it down there.</li>
				<li>Mount Diablo (East Bay): This 3,849 ft mountain provides
					spectacular views of the Bay area. You can drive to the summit or
					if you have time for an adventure, there are hiking trails to the
					top!</li>
