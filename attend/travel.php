			<h1>Travel &amp; Transport</h1>

			<h2>Air Travel</h2>
			<p>
				Three major airports service the greater San Francisco region. The
				major gateway to San Francisco is <a href="http://www.flysfo.com/">San
					Francisco International airport (SFO)</a>, 15 miles south of the
				city. Transportation from the airport to downtown San Francisco is
				available via <a href="https://www.bart.gov/">BART</a> - San
				Francisco&rsquo;s light rail service. The BART station at SFO is
				located inside the International Terminal. To get to the conference
				hotel, take BART to the Embarcadero station &ndash; a 30 minute ride
				that will set you back about $9. The conference venue is directly
				next to the Embarcadero station.
			</p>

			<p>Oakland International Airport (OAK), located across the Bay, is
				also connected to the venue via BART. The recently completed AirBART
				service provides a connection from just outside Oakland&rsquo;s main
				terminal to the Coliseum BART Station. The journey will take about
				40 minutes and cost about $10.</p>

			<p>The conference venue is also accessible from San Jose
				International Airport (SJC). Traveling from SJC to the venue is
				significantly more difficult and time consuming, however. To get to
				the conference venue from SJC, take the VTA bus 10/Airport Flyer
				toward &ldquo;Santa Clara Caltrain&rdquo;; Take Caltrain North to
				the Millbrae stop; Transfer to BART at Millbrae and take it North to
				the Embarcadero stop.</p>

			<h2>Getting Around SF</h2>
			<p>
				BART - BART is the Bay Area&rsquo;s light rail system, and
				it&rsquo;s among the most reliable and cost effective ways to get
				around. <a href="http://www.bart.gov/">bart.gov</a> provides plenty
				of details to help you plan your trip. Several great apps are also
				available to help you plan and keep track of trains in real time.
			</p>
			<p>Note that BART does not run 24 hours. The last trains generally
				leave the end of the line for their final run at midnight, and
				don&rsquo;t start up again until 4am.</p>
			<p>
				Muni - Muni is San Francisco&rsquo;s bus and trolley system. While
				BART only runs one major artery through the city, Muni will take you
				all over, from Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf to Ocean Beach. <a
					href="https://www.sfmta.com">https://www.sfmta.com</a> is your
				source to plan your trip on Muni.
			</p>
			<p>
				AC Transit - If you want to travel around the East Bay by bus, or
				get back and forth from Berkeley/Oakland to SF, you&rsquo;ll need AC
				Transit. AC Transit does run bus service back and forth from the
				East Bay all night, so you&rsquo;ll never be stuck if you&rsquo;re
				out late. All things AC Transit at: <a
					href="http://www.actransit.org">http://www.actransit.org</a>
			</p>
			<p>Taxis/Uber/Lyft - Traditional taxis are common in San Francisco,
				but Uber and Lyft are ubiquitous. You can generally get a Lyft or
				Uber to take you anywhere in the city in just a few minutes. Make
				sure to load up the apps before you arrive.</p>
